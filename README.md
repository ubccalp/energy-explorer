### How do I get set up? ###

* Install NodeJS - https://nodejs.org/en/
* Install Ruby - http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/
* Install Compass and read documentation - http://compass-style.org/install/
* Before making changes to the styles, browse to /assets/styles/cee, open command window in the root folder of styles, run the following command: compass watch
* Other alternative to making changes to the styles is to double-click on the file "compass-watch.bat"
* Run npm install in the command line if you do not see a node_modules folder with all the modules installed. This has to be done at the folder level where app.js exists.
