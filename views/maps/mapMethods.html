    <h1>Map Methodologies</h1>

    <h3>These maps are visuals that show an inventory of the potential capacity for select renewable energy resource across
      the Metro Vancouver region. Much of the energy currently used for our homes comes from remote suppliers in BC and Alberta,
      at least 400-100 kilometers away. These include natural gas to heat our home and electricity to power our homes. The
      focus of these maps is to visualize what local energy solutions would look for Metro Vancouver with the options of
      various renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, hydro (run-of-river), sewage heat recovery, and bioenergy.
      The selection of maps does not reflect constrains of economic viability, social acceptability or current regulations.
      Existing data from various sources are analyzed and mapped using new techniques suitable to communicating energy resources
      at a regional scale.

      <b>About</b>
    </h2>
    <h3>Our suppliers for our homes comes from remote suppliers in BC and Alberta, at least 400-100 kilometers away. Natural
      gas to heat our home is piped from Northeastern BC and Alberta. Electricity to power our homes comes primarily (approximately
      90%) from Hydroelectric dams in southeastern and central BC. This hydroelectricity is supplemented by natural gas electricity
      generation in BC and, at times, by other fossil fuel-based generating plants in Alberta and the United States. Metro
      Vancouver is also crossed by railways and pipelines which ship coal and oil from the oilsands for export. A small portion
      of the oil that is exported is then imported back to Canada to meet our transportation needs. These maps were developed
      by Rory Tooke, PhD. Questions should be sent to

          roof, locate surrounding buildings and trees that could occlude the sun, and (4) model the trajectory of the sun

          the building envelope (i.e. insulation, windows, etc.) and system efficiencies (i.e. furnace, hot water tank, etc.).

          homes perform better than old ones as a general estimate (considering deviation and confidence). The BC Assessment
          data was used to identify the year most homes are built and their size (floor area). This information was used
          in relation to the between the building’s energy use and age to predict energy performances of these buildings
          for all homes in the region. The assessment data also gave the number of units in townhouses, and apartment buildings
