      <h4><b>Baldy Hughes Therapeutic Community, near Prince George, BC 
          </b></h4>
      <h5>When the therapeutic community for addiction recovery began operations at their current site, it soon became apparent
        that meeting their heating requirements with propane would be costly - both in monthly fuel costs and carbon taxes.
        In response, the community pursued funding for installation of a community bioenergy heating system. This $1.3 million
        project, replaced the propane boilers with a biomass system that uses wood pellets as fuel. The wood pellets are
        made from low-cost carbon-neutral wood by-products available in the area. The system has exceeded their expectations, 
		reducing heating costs by 75%. </h5>
