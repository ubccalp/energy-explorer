      <h2>Why cities? Municipality targets?</h2>
      <h3>In response to the reality of climate change, British Columbia committed to taking action, and in 2007 showed world-wide
        leadership by legislated greenhouse gas emissions targets and other provincial and local government policies to help
        mitigate climate change.</h3>
      <h3>Municipalities in BC were quick to follow suit, and many have pledged to reduce their community-wide greenhouse gas
        emissions by up to 80% by 2050—our share of the worldwide reduction necessary to maintain an average global warming
        of 2 degrees.</h3>
      <h3>Some cities are introducing low carbon energy targets, such as Vancouver’s Renewable City Strategy that will ensure the city derives all of its energy from renewable sources prior to 2050.</h3>
