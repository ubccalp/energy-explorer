      <h3> <b>What is community energy?</b>
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Means local efforts to manage how we use energy and where our energy comes from. Community energy refers to multiple energy
        sources and distribution networks that are shared between various members of a geographic neighborhoods, with at
        least part of the energy generated in the local area. This means some degree of local involvement in the management
        and control of the system, with sharing of responsibilities, benefits (including revenue) and impacts among the community.
